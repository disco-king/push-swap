# push-swap

functional version of five elements sorting algorithm in five_elems/

an attempt a at a different algorithm in sort_stack/, but with poor results

a python script in root directory, can be used to provide a series of ints in bash, i.e.:

$>ARG=(python3 nums.py); ./push_swap $ARG

(type the number of ints necessary in the next line)
