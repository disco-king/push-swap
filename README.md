# push-swap

functional version of five elements sort in five_elems/;
an attempt a at a differen algorythm in sort_stack/, but with poor results;


a python script in root directory,
can be used to provide a series of ints in bash, i.e.:
$>ARG=(python3 nums.py); ./push_swap $ARG
(type the number of ints necessary in the next line)
