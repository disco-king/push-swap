functional version of five elements sort in five_elems/\n
an attempt a at a differen algorythm in sort_stack/, but with poor results

a python script in root directory,\n
can be used to provide a series of ints in bash, i.e.:\n
$>ARG=(python3 nums.py); ./push_swap $ARG\n
(type the number of ints necessary in the next line)\n
